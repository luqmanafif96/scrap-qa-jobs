* By adding another duration, *cashback rate cannot be the same as the previous created duration within the submission*. (if not will prompt error msg)

* For hybrid  Model, if user created one entry and waned to create another entry with a only one different rate, user able to, but if both the same cashback , validation should occur.

Eg of first entry : Cashback offset = 5% , FPL fee = 5%

          second entry : Cashback offset = 6% , FPL fee = 5%

Currently, existing merchants who did not signed and we gave them the default freemium, if those merchants have signed down the road and the fee will only picks up when the freemium exhausted. This seems creating a lost to the business of average 5-10k a month.

*Given that* existing merchant that have yet to signed FPL contract was granted x amount of freemium, *When* BD signed FPL contract for the existing merchant, then FPL status is completed, it should zerorise the freemium.

+*Acceptance criteria:*+

*  If user submit FPL for an existing merchant that have yet to signed contract but had freemium, once user submitted → contract signed → when through vetting/content & designer status switch to completed. Freemium will be zerorise.
* If the existing merchant without submission previously being submitted on MC, once ops team done,{{ status = completed.}}  On admin tool, *Remaining Freemium Transaction Count* field will be zerorize and the remaining count will be fill into *Freemium Transaction up to* filed, this is to tally back if there’s any audit dispute.

* Caused by a long-running deal from 2019. This deal has many changes, and causes the change history to take a very long time to load.
* Even though we are using a pagination approach, we are still loading all of the records from database and then only paginating that result.
* Because we still load all of the records from database, the requests times out as the query takes a long time to complete.","22/Dec/21 7:27 PM;61079ef7b704b40068e99bb1;Solution: *Use pagination on the Version model level rather than loading all of the records from the database.*

*Solution* : No need to create new company manager if the email OR phone number already exist 



*Solution* *:*  changing the validation to match email, so when we hit a existing phone number on MC, we will be attaching the company to the existing company manager

+*Acceptance Criteria :*+
*Normal Case Scenarios - basic flow of the story* 

* Under *Favepay & deal* product creation under “*apply to outlets*” section, user should have the option to tagged “*All Outlets*”.
* {{All outlets }}will be representing outlets which are *outlet status = active* 
* once user tagged “All outlets” , system should auto tagged all the outlets under this field individually.  For example : Profile Fave has 10 outlet, when BD tagged all outlets to the deals, individual outlet name will be auto  tagged under this field.


*Alternative Case Scenarios - success flow/optional flow other than basic flow*

* Specifically to *Favepay ,* when user creating a favepay submission , the outlet will need to be validated with two information: - Outlet status = active and if outlet which already tagged on other draft favepay within that submission should not be appearing as well.

*Negative flow*

* if outlet only left One, that technically “All Outlets” should not show.",,Katelyn Soo,,,,557058:2f835b06-e18a-42a8-af45-3231fc68d42c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08/Jan/21 2:39 PM;katelyn@myfave.com;image-20210108-033022.png;https://kfit-asia.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/49823/image-20210108-033022.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We want SPECIFIC examples you can use the GHERKIN https://docs.cucumber.io/gherkin/reference/

CH detected several tickets this year where the user escalated the following:

# User purchased a Fave Deal in SG but the deal shows an odd 7-digit schema for the receipt which is outside our norm.
# Transaction is not recorded in the payment history on consumer app.
# Voucher purchase is not found inside the AT records by CH
# Transaction was found on the Adyen portal but reversing the search using PSP reference, there are still no results on AT.
# Consumer behaviour mapping also seems off; Clevertap detected a {{charged}} event at 3:10AM but transaction was performed at 3:00AM recorded on AT.

For further information, please click on the 2 slack escalations made:

# [https://myfave.slack.com/archives/G8B0Q87CL/p1611466679003200|https://myfave.slack.com/archives/G8B0Q87CL/p1611466679003200] - User ID: 5393960

+*Solution/Impact*+

CH is not able to track these transactions efficiently. Especially if these are sensitive time-bound refund escalations. 2 cases alone have happened in the last 3 weeks of January 2021.

[~accountid:557058:faad2d03-058e-4ab4-a282-e9c3543f9e39] advised we need engineering effort to investigate as PMs has no access to production db. Expectation is to do the following:

# Investigate why the transactions are creating 7-digit receipt IDs
# Investigate the linkage on why Adyen would track the transaction but not AT

Investigation result: ok it's not fraud, when receipt id is null, we show the eagle_reservation id as the receipt id on mobile side.

It's not related to Adyen.

*Tech proposal:*

propose to just add more logging and datadog tracking for that API and send an alarm when it happens again on two places


# when we create transaction and receipt id is nil
# when reservation api is called and the reservation.receipt id is nil

as for PMs lets workout SOP for cases of receipt id is 7 characters. They need to go to the user's reservations and verify if the receipt id matches any of the reservation id for further action.","27/Jan/21 3:08 PM;5fb29867d670b8006e5adf16;acknowledge, have communicated the SOP to the CH team in the mean time.",,,,,Done

Referencing the conversation above & the reseller order status query module, [~accountid:557058:174b35c3-38b4-4055-b3de-d8c8e41a3a7c] had explained that this function of Admin Tool only works for Shell & Lazada resellers that provide us pregenerated codes & can be queried using field {{order_number}}. This does not work exactly for Marketplace resellers which uses {{order_id}}.

In our conversation with UOB, it had been remarked as (though actually optional) preferable for them as a reseller to send us the field {{order_id}}. We had advised them to send this field (which will be their native app transaction reference, 16 digits) in this field for us to receive it via Marketplace.

This was pitched to them to adopt as a “Plan B” escalation approach (otherwise they would have said no to the additional work) if say, a user files a complaint on their Fave Deal purchase via UOB Mighty App since;

# UOB will not be sending us any identifying information about the user via the marketplace request but use a representative/dummy PII data
# The web-receipt enhancement which will show the receipt ID is also (at this point of time) still developing & UOB mentioned that the accessibility to this receipt is not straightforward.



+*Solution*+

Enhance the Admin Tool to have an additional query parameter for {{order_id}} (Search by Order ID for Marketplace) on the reseller order status query.

This new query param needs to work together with the {{city_slug}} (Select City)

Previous work referenced for this query module: [https://github.com/kfit-dev/kfit-app/pull/4967|https://github.com/kfit-dev/kfit-app/pull/4967|smart-link] ; [https://kfit-asia.atlassian.net/browse/IA-248|https://kfit-asia.atlassian.net/browse/IA-248|smart-link]  (archived project)

Context from [~accountid:557058:0f7200b8-796f-42d0-8c94-9aa926f002c0] 

{quote}so base from the github we have a concept of {{ResellerOrderTracker}} where you can search by order number
here are the info we can get in that model:{quote}

{noformat}# Table name: reseller_order_trackers
#
#  created_at        :datetime         not null

#  updated_at        :datetime         not null
#  user_id           :integer{noformat}



From our FAQ this is what we have on {{resellerCode}}

[https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Marketplace-API-FAQ-Current-Issues-Faves-Internal-Use-Only--BHKt0LiBIKW2BctdsZnDkDslAg-x9w9B54fAyBew7CtHNc9E|https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Marketplace-API-FAQ-Current-Issues-Faves-Internal-Use-Only--BHKt0LiBIKW2BctdsZnDkDslAg-x9w9B54fAyBew7CtHNc9E]

* When required to extract details from resellers (Akulaku, Tokopedia, Ovo etc). We save external order ids in the ResellerCode model, order_id column. 

{{ResellerCode.find_by(order_id: ""40354025"")}}


* Voucher web redemption url. To obtain the redemption url link, use the model method redeem_url of the Reseller Code model. Use the city slug as a parameter.

{{ResellerCode.find_by(order_id: ""40354025"").redeem_url(""jakarta"")}}

* Email reminder ,depending when its launch, it will be trigger on a weekly basis for continuously 6 week, and following week will be a bi-weekly trigger *(two week once)*
* Email remainder will only be sent to active favepay merchant that has status link = pending 
* the reminder can be switch off using flipper
* Validation needed :  (1) Check whether is active favepay merchant (run through all the outlet weather is there favepay enable) , (2) link status = pending > if yes - sent reminder


*What if? Scenarios - (if any)*

* If mid way wanted to add in to the merchant list, we should be able to add in the merchant ID
* If merchant id added half way of the reminder, it will follow the existing process and will not reset to go through the whole cycle. Eg: we sent out 2 reminder , and  3rd week we added a merchant , hence the merchant will received 4 weekly reminder > bi-weekly reminder until we switch it off

h2. +*Favepay Dashboard*+

* Adding an additional Colum “*FP Later Submitted*” on Favepay live dashboard before favepay status
* FP Later submitted = *Y* , meaning in the submission there’s FPL created
* FP Later submitted = *N* , meaning in the submission there’s NO FPL 

!image-20210907-030302.png|width=100%!

* Under View details , will have an additional FPL Remark to ops box, this will reflect the remark user inputted on the Remark to ops on the FPL creation page on MC.
* This box will only appear if the submission has FPL, If no will be hidden.

!image-20210724-174525.png|width=100%!

*What if? Scenarios - (if any)*

New Merchant submission 

* FPL + FP needs to be submitted together , hence, on the dashboard  FP Later Submitted = Yes, Favepay Status = FP enabled on outlet , and the FPL remark box will display.



Existing FP Merchant Submission

* FPL can be submitted as a stand alone product, hence status for *FP Later Submitted* will be *Yes* and *FP* will depending on the current live status*, FPL remark box will be shown.*

*Misuse Cases and Negative Scenarios - (if any)*

* To have log , for future debugging.

{{inactive - past feature AND redemption period.}}

* The error message {{Tag has already been taken}} was shown.
* This error message was caused by {{sync_deal_tags}} in {{eagle_activity.rb}}. Previously this wasn't a problem because tags were case sensitive.
* However, due to the introduction of {{acts_as_ordered_taggable_on}} in the {{EagleActivity}} model, this might have made the tags case insensitive.
* Because Project Billy and our old Tagging system had inconsistencies between capitalization, the {{uniq}} function was not able to remove duplicates. The case insensitivity problem happens and gives this error message.","22/Oct/21 10:50 AM;61079ef7b704b40068e99bb1;Tested in {{columbus}}
